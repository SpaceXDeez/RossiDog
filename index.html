            while she was walking her sweet dog PJ. I’m so happy I found her! Lucky was spoiled rotten during his stay,
            and they kept him on his routine of an hour long walk every morning. I trust the Rossi family with our fur
            baby anytime."

From the moment we met Dayna, PJ (their dog!) and her twin girls, we felt completely at ease leaving our "baby" in their care. They treated Bo like their own, giving him so much love, attention, and playtime, even his first dinner out at a restaurant! We received regular updates and photos that clearly showed how happy and comfortable he was, which made being away so much easier for our family. It's such a relief to have found a family so trustworthy, attentive, and passionate about dogs. We will absolutely be using them again (and again!) and highly recommend them to anyone looking for exceptional care for their dog."
